= AWX Client Architecture
:toc:
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Overview

The client package provides a simple, direct approach for creating AWX API clients from Connection objects.

== Core Components

=== ClientFactory

A single class that handles all client creation and caching:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class ClientFactory {
    // Internal map as a simple ConcurrentHashMap
    private final Map<String, AwxClient> clientMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
    // Create or retrieve clients
    public AwxClient createClient(Connection connection, String clientId) { ... }
    
    // Client management
    public void removeClient(String clientId) { ... }
    public void clearAllClients() { ... }
    
    // WebClient creation
    protected WebClient createWebClient(String baseUrl, String username, 
                                       String password, boolean skipTlsVerify) { ... }
}

@startuml
participant "Service" as S
participant "ClientFactory" as F
participant "HttpServiceProxyFactory" as H

S -> F: createClient(connection, clientId)
activate F

F -> F: Check clientMap.get(clientId)

alt client exists in map
  F --> S: Return cached client
else client does not exist
  F -> F: createWebClient(url, username, password, skipTlsVerify)
  
  F -> H: createClient(AwxClient.class)
  activate H
  H --> F: AwxClient
  deactivate H
  
  F -> F: clientMap.put(clientId, client)
  
  F --> S: Return new client
end

deactivate F

== Usage Example

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private ClientFactory clientFactory;

public ProjectInfo createProject(Connection connection, String connectionId, Project project) {
    AwxClient client = clientFactory.createClient(connection, connectionId);
    return client.createProject(project).block(); // Only reactive at API boundary
}
----

== Design Decisions

=== Single Class Responsibility

The design minimizes components to just what's needed:

* Single `ClientFactory` class handles all responsibilities 
* No separate cache class - direct use of ConcurrentHashMap
* No separate customizer - WebClient creation is an implementation detail

=== Non-Reactive Approach 

The design uses direct returns instead of reactive types:

* Simple and straightforward synchronous API
* Reactive types only used at API boundaries (WebClient)
* No unnecessary complexity

=== Interface-based Clients

We use Spring's HTTP interface client pattern to create proxy clients:

* Declarative client creation
* No need for manual request/response handling
* Consistent with Spring WebFlux patterns

== Conclusion

This architecture provides an extremely minimal approach to creating clients from Connection objects, with maximum simplicity. The entire client creation functionality is encapsulated in a single focused class.
