= AWX Resource Operator

== Overview

The AWX Resource Operator is a Kubernetes operator designed to manage AWX resources. This operator is built using Spring Boot and follows a REST-based architectural pattern.

== Technical Stack

* Java 21
* Spring Boot 3.2.3
* Spring WebFlux
* Reactive Programming with Reactor
* Maven
* Lombok

== AWX REST Client

The operator includes a REST client to interact with AWX instances. The client uses Spring WebFlux's `HttpInterface` to simplify API calls.

=== Configuration

Configure your AWX connection in `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
# AWX Connection Properties
awx.baseUrl=http://your-awx-instance:8052
awx.username=your-username
awx.password=your-password
----

=== Available Operations

* List AWX Projects: Returns projects from the AWX instance
* Get Project by ID: Retrieves a specific project by its ID
* Create Project: Creates a new project in AWX
* Delete Project: Removes a project from AWX

== Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

The operator uses DTOs to facilitate data exchange with the AWX API.

=== Project

The `Project` class represents an AWX project entity with the following fields:

[source,java]
----
public class Project {
    private Integer id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private String scmType;
    private String scmUrl;
    private String scmBranch;
    private OffsetDateTime created;
    private OffsetDateTime modified;
    private String status;
}
----

=== CreateProjectDTO

The `CreateProjectDTO` is used specifically for creating new projects. It contains only the fields necessary for project creation:

[source,java]
----
public class CreateProjectDTO {
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private String scmType;
    private String scmUrl;
    private String scmBranch;
}
----

=== ProjectListResponse

The `ProjectListResponse` is used to parse paginated results from the AWX API:

[source,java]
----
public class ProjectListResponse {
    private Integer count;
    private String next;
    private String previous;
    private List<Project> results;
}
----

== Development

=== Building the Project

To build the project, run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

=== Running Tests

To run the tests:

[source,bash]
----
mvn test
----

== Project Structure

The project follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

* `interfaces` - API definitions, DTOs, and contracts
  ** `interfaces.client` - HTTP interface client definitions
  ** `interfaces.dto` - Data transfer objects for AWX resources
  ** `interfaces.service` - Service interfaces that provide AWX functionality
* `clients` - External service clients and configurations
  ** `clients.config` - Client configurations
* `business` - Core business logic
  ** `business.service` - Service layer for business operations
* `application` - Application configuration and bootstrap

More implementation details will be added as the project evolves.
